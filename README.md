This project is a machine learning application for classifying images as "Real" or "Fake" using various deep learning models, including Vision Transformer (ViT), ResNet50, VGG16, and a custom CNN. The app is built with Streamlit, allowing users to upload images, select a model, and receive predictions with confidence scores.
